## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **State Management**: Will use Context API (no Redux) - app complexity doesn't require Redux
2. **API Client**: Axios with interceptors for auth handling
3. **Routing**: React Router v6 with lazy loading for code splitting
4. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (matching current approach)
5. **Build Tool**: Vite (fast, modern, good DX)

### Key Technical Considerations
- Backend will serve both API (`/api/*`) and static React build (`/*`)
- Session-based auth will use `credentials: 'include'` in Axios
- CORS will be configured properly for development
- Production build will be served from `client/dist/`

### Potential Challenges
1. **Session Cookie Handling**: Need to ensure cookies work with CORS
2. **MFA Flow**: Complex multi-step auth needs careful state management
3. **Study Session**: Complex animations and state - highest risk area
4. **File Upload/Download**: Import/Export features need FormData handling

## Phase 2: Starting - Chuyển đổi Backend sang API Mode

**Current Task**: Task 2.1 - Tạo API routes mới

### Strategy
Instead of rewriting all routes from scratch, we'll modify existing routes to:
1. Keep all existing logic (models, business logic, auth)
2. Change response from `res.render()` to `res.json()`
3. Add `/api` prefix to routes
4. Keep session-based auth (no changes needed)

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Create `/api` router wrapper
2. 🔄 Modify auth routes to return JSON
3. ⬜ Modify dashboard route
4. ⬜ Modify sets routes
5. ⬜ Modify folders routes
6. ⬜ Modify flashcards routes
7. ⬜ Modify study routes
8. ⬜ Modify shares routes
9. ⬜ Modify admin routes
